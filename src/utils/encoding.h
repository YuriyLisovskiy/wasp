// Convert an Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) portion to a URI
// portion that is suitable for inclusion in a URL.
// This is the algorithm from section 3.1 of RFC 3987, slightly simplified
// since the input is assumed to be a string rather than an arbitrary byte
// stream.
//
// Take an IRI string, e.g. '/I â™¥ Wasp/' and return a string containing the
// encoded result with ASCII chars only (e.g. '/I%20%E2%99%A5%20Wasp/').
//
// The list of safe characters here is constructed from the "reserved" and
// "unreserved" characters specified in sections 2.2 and 2.3 of RFC 3986:
//     reserved    = gen-delims / sub-delims
//     gen-delims  = ":" / "/" / "?" / "#" / "[" / "]" / "@"
//     sub-delims  = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")"
//                   / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="
//     unreserved  = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
//
// The % character is also added to the list of safe characters here, as the
// end of section 3.1 of RFC 3987 specifically mentions that % must not be
// converted.
